 <!-- Because the script is in the head section,
       it is likely that at the time the onclick event is referenced in js
       the clickMe button has not  been created in the DOM.
       Hence, it is more appropriate to have the script element just 
       after the clickMe button or at the end of the page.

       Alternatively, use the window.onload() method in js to ensure
       all elements have been loaded. The Disadvantage is time to load all elements.
